Chapter-3 | A FRAMEWORK FOR SYSTEM DESIGN INTERVIEWS
------------------------
4 Step process

Step 1 - Understand the problem and establish design scope
    - What specific features are we going to build?
    - How many users does the product have?
    - How fast does the company anticipate to scale up? What are the anticipated scales in 3 months, 6 months, and a year?
    - What is the company’s technology stack? What existing services you might leverage to simplify the design?

Step 2 - Propose high-level design and get buy-in
Step 3 - Design deep dive
Step 4 - Wrap up

CHAPTER 4: DESIGN A RATE LIMITER
------------------------
Algorithms for rate limiting
    - Token bucket
    - Leaking bucket
    - Fixed window counter
    - Sliding window log
    - Sliding window counter

The token bucket algorithm takes two parameters:
• Bucket size: the maximum number of tokens allowed in the bucket
• Refill rate: number of tokens put into the bucket every second

CHAPTER 5: DESIGN CONSISTENT HASHING
